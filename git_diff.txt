I created a file on master and added some data in it and then used git diff. what will be the output ?

The output of git diff command will show the difference between the contents of the file in your local repository 
(i.e., the file you created and added data to) and the latest version of the same file in the master branch. 
If you have not yet committed your changes to the local repository, the output of git diff will show the differences 
between your local file and the latest committed version in the master branch.
