what is git fetching
git fetch is a Git command used to retrieve commits and other references from a remote repository and store them in your local repository. 
This allows you to see what changes have been made to the remote repository and to merge them with your local repository.
The git fetch command downloads only the data that is new or changed in the remote repository, 
and does not modify the contents of your local repository. Instead, the downloaded data is stored in your local repository as "remote branches," 
which you can use to inspect the changes, create new branches based on the remote data, or merge the changes into your local branches.

In summary, git fetch is a way to retrieve updates from a remote repository without affecting your local repository's current state.

for example : 

Here's an example scenario to illustrate the use of git fetch:
Let's say you have a remote repository named "origin" and a local repository with a branch named "master." 
The remote repository has two branches, "master" and "feature." The "feature" branch contains new changes that you would 
like to merge into your local repository.

To retrieve the changes from the "feature" branch in the remote repository, you would run the following command:
git fetch origin feature

This will download the latest changes from the "feature" branch in the remote repository and store them in your local repository 
as a remote branch named "origin/feature."
You can then inspect the changes using the git log command, and merge them into your local "master" branch with the git merge command:

git log origin/feature
git merge origin/feature

These commands will show you the changes in the "feature" branch and merge them into your local "master" branch, 
allowing you to keep your local repository up to date with the remote repository.
