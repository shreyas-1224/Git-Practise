What is git rebasing ?

Let's say you have a main branch named master, and you created a new branch named feature to work on a new feature for your project. 
While you were working on the feature branch, the master branch was updated with several new commits.

Here's what the commit history of the two branches might look like:

master: A - B - C - D - E
feature: A - F - G - H


In this example, commit A is the same in both branches because it's the starting point of the feature branch. 
Commits B, C, D, and E were made on the master branch, while commits F, G, and H were made on the feature branch.

If you now want to merge the changes from the feature branch into the master branch, you could use rebasing to simplify the process. 
To rebase the feature branch onto the master branch, you would run the following command:

$ git checkout feature
$ git rebase master

What Git does now is to reapply each of the commits from the feature branch, one by one, on top of the latest state of the master branch. 
So in this case, Git would reapply commits F, G, and H on top of commit E of the master branch. Here's what the new commit history would look like:

master: A - B - C - D - E
feature: A - B - C - D - E - F' - G' - H'

As you can see, the feature branch now appears as if it was developed directly on top of the master branch,
and the changes from the feature branch have been incorporated into the master branch.

This example is a simplified scenario and rebasing can get more complex when there are conflicts between the two branches. 
In such cases, Git will stop the rebasing process and ask you to resolve the conflicts before continuing. 
It's important to understand the potential consequences of rebasing and to use it with caution, 
especially when working with shared branches that other people may be using.
